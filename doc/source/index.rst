Welcome to CONCOCT's documentation!
===================================

CONCOCT is a program for unsupervised binning of metagenomic contigs by using nucleotide composition, 
coverage data in multiple samples and linkage data from paired end reads.

Warning! This software is to be considered under development. Functionality and the user interface may still change significantly from one version to another.
If you want to use this software, please stay up to date with the list of known issues:

Features
--------
CONCOCT is a tool for accurately (up to species level) bin metagenomic contigs. For optmial performance:

- Map several samples against your assembled contigs.
- Cut longer contigs into 10 - 20 kb pieces prior to mapping.
- Evaluate your bins using single copy genes.

Installation
------------
For a comprehensive guide on how to install CONCOCT and all its dependencies, see :doc:`installation`.
